description = [=[Exos now have a periodically activated short-range scanner which detects alien players. Alien players with a cloaking value of 0.5 or more are not detected by the periodic scan. The minigun exo has in addition to the scan received a new mode called "Siege Mode". Siege Mode decreases the rate of fire of the minigun to 25% of the base value but increases the damage first by a factor of 4 and is then increased by 10%. Minigun exos cannot move while in Siege Mode and have their fuel set to zero. Siege Mode can be activated and deactivated once every five seconds. The price of exos are now 62 player resources per minigun exo and 60 player resources per railgun exo. The minigun sound has been changed and is played differently based on whether the minigun exo is in Siege Mode or not. Press your reload key to enter and leave Siege Mode!]=]
